## üîÑ Sending Updates

When you need to send a new version to testers:

1. **Increment version in** `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   versionCode 2  // Increment by 1
   versionName "1.0.2"  // Update version
   ```

2. **Rebuild the APK:**
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

3. **Find the new APK:**
   ```
   android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```
