# Android Setup Guide - God Moments App

## âœ… Build Status
The Android APK has been successfully built! The JDK issue has been resolved by configuring Gradle to use JDK 17.

## Configuration Changes Made

### 1. Fixed JDK Version
Added to `android/gradle.properties`:
```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home
```
This ensures Gradle always uses JDK 17 (required for React Native 0.76+).

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Physical Android Device (Recommended for notifications)

1. **Enable Developer Mode** on your Android device:
   - Go to Settings > About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Developer Options will be enabled

2. **Enable USB Debugging**:
   - Go to Settings > Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"
   - Connect device via USB

3. **Verify Connection**:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```
   You should see your device listed.

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lallen30/Documents/bluestoneapps/clients/God-Moments/repos/God-Moments-react-app
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

### Option 2: Android Emulator

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Open Device Manager**: Tools > Device Manager
3. **Create Virtual Device** if none exists:
   - Click "Create Device"
   - Select a phone (e.g., Pixel 6)
   - Select Android 13 (API 33) or higher
   - Click "Finish"

4. **Launch Emulator** from Device Manager

5. **Verify Emulator is Running**:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

6. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lallen30/Documents/bluestoneapps/clients/God-Moments/repos/God-Moments-react-app
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

### Option 3: Install APK Directly

1. **Transfer APK** to your Android device:
   - Email it to yourself
   - Use cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
   - Use adb: `adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

2. **Install APK** on device:
   - Open the APK file on your device
   - Allow installation from unknown sources if prompted
   - Tap "Install"

## Testing OneSignal Notifications (Android)

Based on your memory, OneSignal is configured with these Android-specific settings:

### AndroidManifest.xml Configuration
- âœ… Launch mode: `singleTop` (critical for notification handling)
- âœ… Deep link scheme: `godmoments`
- âœ… OneSignal notification icon configured
- âœ… POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission for Android 13+

### OneSignalService.ts (Android-specific)
- âœ… Android-specific delays for notification click handling (100ms, 300ms)
- âœ… Android app state change monitoring
- âœ… Platform-specific handling for bringing app to foreground

### Test Notifications

1. **Launch the app** on your Android device/emulator
2. **Check logs** for OneSignal initialization:
   ```bash
   npx react-native log-android
   ```
   Look for:
   - `ðŸš€ [OneSignal] Starting initialization`
   - `âœ… [OneSignal] Login successful`
   - `âœ… OneSignal User ID found`

3. **Send test notification** from OneSignal dashboard:
   - Go to https://app.onesignal.com
   - Navigate to Messages > Push
   - Click "New Push"
   - Target: All Users or specific device
   - Send notification

4. **Test notification click**:
   - Tap the notification
   - App should open/come to foreground
   - Check logs for click handling

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Adb - No devices and/or emulators connected"
**Solution**: Launch an emulator or connect a physical device, then verify with `adb devices`.

### Issue: "JDK version mismatch"
**Solution**: Already fixed! `gradle.properties` now forces JDK 17.

### Issue: "Build fails with CMake errors"
**Solution**: Clean and rebuild:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Issue: Notifications not received on Android
**Solution**: 
1. Check `google-services.json` is present in `android/app/`
2. Verify Firebase project matches package name: `com.bluestoneapps.miinojibwe`
3. Check OneSignal App ID is correct: `2613c87d-4f81-4094-bd84-08495e68bda0`
4. Ensure device has internet connection
5. Check notification permissions are granted

## Important Files

- **APK Location**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- **Gradle Config**: `android/gradle.properties`
- **Android Manifest**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
