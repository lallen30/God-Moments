# Fix Church Bell Sound Not Playing

## The Issue
Notifications are working but playing DEFAULT sound instead of church bell.
This means `church_bell.caf` is NOT in the app bundle.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Open Xcode
```bash
cd /Users/lallen30/Documents/bluestoneapps/clients/God-Moments/repos/God-Moments-react-app
open ios/GodMoments.xcworkspace
```

### 2. Verify Sound File is Added to Project

**In Xcode's left sidebar (Project Navigator):**
- Look for `church_bell.caf` in the GodMoments folder
- It should appear in the file list

**If you DON'T see it:**
- Drag `ios/GodMoments/church_bell.caf` from Finder into Xcode's GodMoments folder
- When dialog appears:
  - âœ… Check "Copy items if needed"
  - âœ… Check "Create groups"
  - âœ… Select "GodMoments" target (NOT GodMomentsTests)
  - Click "Finish"

### 3. CRITICAL: Verify in Build Phases

This is the most important step!

1. Click on **GodMoments** project (blue icon at top of sidebar)
2. Select **GodMoments** target (under TARGETS)
3. Click **"Build Phases"** tab
4. Expand **"Copy Bundle Resources"**
5. **Look for `church_bell.caf` in the list**

**If church_bell.caf is NOT in "Copy Bundle Resources":**
- Click the **"+"** button at the bottom of the list
- Find and select **church_bell.caf**
- Click **"Add"**

### 4. Clean and Rebuild

**IMPORTANT: You MUST do a clean build!**

1. **Clean Build Folder**: 
   - Menu: Product â†’ Clean Build Folder
   - Or: Shift + Cmd + K

2. **Delete app from iPhone**:
   - Long press the God Moments app on your iPhone
   - Tap "Remove App" â†’ "Delete App"
   - This ensures old bundle is completely removed

3. **Build and Run**:
   - Menu: Product â†’ Run
   - Or: Cmd + R
   - Wait for app to install on iPhone

### 5. Test the Sound

After the app installs, run the test:
```

```

You should now hear the church bell! ðŸ””

## Troubleshooting

### Still hearing default sound?
1. Check iPhone Settings â†’ God Moments â†’ Notifications â†’ Sounds is ON
2. Make sure iPhone is NOT in silent mode (check physical switch)
3. Verify the sound file is in Build Phases â†’ Copy Bundle Resources

### How to verify sound is in app bundle:
After building, check the build output:
```bash
# In Terminal, from the react-app directory:
ls -la ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/GodMoments.app/ | grep church_bell
```

You should see `church_bell.caf` listed.

### Alternative: Use Archive Build
If Debug build doesn't work, try:
1. Product â†’ Scheme â†’ Edit Scheme
2. Change "Build Configuration" from Debug to Release
3. Clean and rebuild

## Why This Happens
Xcode doesn't automatically include all files in the project folder.
Files must be explicitly added to "Copy Bundle Resources" to be included in the app bundle.
